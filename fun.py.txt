# Hey there I'm your boyfriend :) and I will show you some basics in python today.
#
# First off let's start with some theory and what you see on your screen:
# 
# What is python and why is it important? - Python is this fun and easy to use programing language for fun and 
# experementation you can use it to create fun little projects, like research one or a minigame or anything you want.
# The important part is that it's easy and fun to start with.
#
# How do I make a game? - For our cool games we have Unity Engine. It is a collection of helpful free tools that we 
# don't have to make our selfs. They help us make really cool looking games like the ones we played:) But we will 
# not be usinng them right now. Since for now we will just get familiar with the basics and python is perfect for
# that because of it's simplicity.
#
# Hmm files - On the left you will spot your folder called pystuff and inside you will notice a file called fun.py, 
# you can call it anything you want like even super_fun.py, though you gotta make sure that it ends
# with .py and that it doesn't have any spaces :) Inside your file you can write some fun code that the 
# computer will then execute. In here you can tell the computer to do whatever you want it to do.
#
# How do I run it? - We can run it by pressing that start icon on the top right corner and when we do it our comands
# will come to life. You can alternativly type in python and then the name of your python file where in this case it 
# is fun.py and then hit enter and whooo magic.
# 
# How do I make fun comands - Do you remember scratch, yes that fun game with the cat. In scratch you have these
# puzzle peices that you can drag and drop, and they cick nicely with each other, and you can mix and match those
# peices to make the cat do what you want. It is very simmilar in python. Here you also have puzzle peices, and
# can mix and match them in different ways to make the program do what you want it to do, shal we take a look.
#
# How do the puzzle peices work here and what are they? - Here you type out your puzzle peices and there is much
# more of them then in scratch ;) so that means you can do wayyy more. There are some built in ones that you can
# just type but there are also other ones from othe people that you can add and use.
#
# Puzzle peices basics - Lets start with our first puzzle peice. we call it a variable, though it could be called
# anything, you can call it cat, mouse, love_message or even boyfriend, (make sure not to have spaces). We can
# assign anything we want too our variable and then use it later in the program, our variable could be a number,
# a text, a song or a picture. Let's start with a text and a number

# here I'm ceating a variable I'm calling it my_cat and I'm assigning it the task (with =) of carying my number 3
my_cat = 3

# and here is another one I'm gonna call it daisy and assign it hmm... 
# maybe the text hi (nake sure to use 'and put the text inside')
daisy = 'hi how are you today?'

# TODO: here make your own below with a number or a text and you can call it anything you want and assign it anything :)

you = "you can't read"

# hmm pretty boring so far :( let's do something more exciting. So now we know how we can store basic information.
# But we can do that on a peice of paper as well. Well so let's make it come to life with something called functions.
# Functionsn are these building blocks that you can use to make things come to life. Let me show you how hey work;}

# so let's start by creating one, and then I will show you how to use them let's start with something simple
# maybe we could add 2 numbers together like let's say... numbers 2 and 3. So how could we do that
